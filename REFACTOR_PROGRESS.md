# Refactor Progress Summary

## Current Status
- **Branch**: `refactor/simplify-core`
- **Phase**: 1 of 4 completed
- **Last Commit**: "refactor: Phase 1 - Simplify core architecture"

## Completed Work

### Phase 1: Core Refactor ✓
1. **Created Common Utilities Module** (`clab_tools/common/`)
   - `handle_success()` and `handle_error()` for consistent UI patterns
   - `with_lab_context` decorator for command validation
   - `setup_remote_config()` for unified remote configuration

2. **Simplified DatabaseManager**
   - Made lab-aware by default with `default_lab` parameter
   - Added `set_lab()` and `get_current_lab()` methods
   - All methods now accept optional `lab_name` parameter

3. **Removed LabAwareDB Wrapper**
   - Eliminated `clab_tools/db/context.py` wrapper class
   - Simplified to return DatabaseManager directly

4. **Updated Commands**
   - `import_csv.py`: Now uses new utilities and simplified context
   - `data_commands.py`: Updated to use new patterns
   - `generate_topology.py`: Fixed to work with lab-aware DatabaseManager

5. **Fixed Tests**
   - Removed all `lab_aware_db` and `populated_lab_aware_db` references
   - Tests now use `db_manager` directly
   - All tests passing

## Next Steps for Continuing Model

### Phase 2: Command Reorganization (Next)
The refactor proposal outlines reorganizing commands into groups. Here's what needs to be done:

1. **Create command groups in `main.py`**:
   ```python
   # Instead of flat commands, create groups:
   @cli.group()
   def lab():
       """Lab management commands."""
       pass

   @cli.group()
   def data():
       """Data management commands."""
       pass

   @cli.group()
   def topology():
       """Topology generation commands."""
       pass

   @cli.group()
   def bridge():
       """Bridge management commands."""
       pass
   ```

2. **Move existing commands under groups**:
   - `lab_commands.py` → Already grouped, just needs to be registered as `lab`
   - `import_csv` → Move to `data.command('import')`
   - `show_data` → Move to `data.command('show')`
   - `clear_data` → Move to `data.command('clear')`
   - `generate_topology` → Move to `topology.command('generate')`
   - Bridge commands → Group under `bridge`

3. **Update command decorators** in each file:
   ```python
   # Old: @click.command()
   # New: @click.command('import')  # with explicit name
   ```

4. **Update imports in `main.py`** to register groups instead of individual commands

5. **Test all commands** work with new structure:
   ```bash
   clab-tools lab create test
   clab-tools data import -n nodes.csv -c connections.csv
   clab-tools topology generate -o output.yml
   clab-tools bridge create
   ```

### Phase 3: Bridge Enhancement
- Refactor BridgeManager to support individual bridge creation
- Add commands for manual bridge management
- Currently only supports bulk operations from topology

### Phase 4: Documentation Update
- Fix all command examples in docs/ to match new structure
- Update shell script examples
- Create migration guide (though user said not needed)

## Important Context

### User Requirements
- **No backward compatibility needed** - User is primary user
- **Shell script workflows** are important - See `REFACTOR_PROPOSAL.md` for examples
- **Remote nodes** - Configs will be pushed to containerized router nodes, not the host
- **Trunk-based development** - Short-lived branches, PR to main, tag releases

### Technical Decisions Made
1. DatabaseManager is now inherently lab-aware
2. Common utilities centralize UI patterns
3. No wrapper classes - direct access to DatabaseManager
4. Tests mock bridge operations (can't run locally)

### Files to Reference
- `REFACTOR_PROPOSAL.md` - Complete refactor plan
- `CLAUDE.md` - Codebase guide for AI assistants
- `.git/refs/heads/refactor/simplify-core` - Current branch

## Commands to Continue

```bash
# Ensure you're on the right branch
git checkout refactor/simplify-core

# Run tests to verify current state
python -m pytest tests/ -v

# Start Phase 2 implementation
# (See Phase 2 steps above)
```

## Testing Approach
- Unit tests for new command structure
- Integration tests for command groups
- Mock bridge operations (user can't test locally)
- Verify shell scripts still work with new commands
